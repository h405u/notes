\chapter{Linear Models for Regression}

A helpful insight is that when
\begin{equation*}
  Ax=b
  % \label{eq:}
\end{equation*}
is irresolvable ($A$ being not invertible, etc), we turn to $A^{\dag}$ instead to achieve an optimal result in the sense that $\|Ax-b\|$ is minimized. This is a motivation for \textit{Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse} matrix.
