\begin{reference}{Defn}{optimizationproblem}
  An \emph{instance} of an \emph{optimization problem} is a pair $(F,c)$, where $F$ is any set, the domain of feasible pointsand $c$ the cost function, a mapping $c:F\to \mathbb R$. The problem is to find an $f\in F$ for which $c(f)\leq c(y)$ for all $y\in F$. Such a point $f$ is called a \textit{globally optimal} (or simply \emph{optimal}) solution to the given instance. An \emph{optimization problem} is a set $I$ of instances of an optimization problem.
